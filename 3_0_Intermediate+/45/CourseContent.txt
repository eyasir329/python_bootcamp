Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup
- Use find to look for elements based on HTML tags and attributes
- Use find_all to look for all elements satisfying the parameters (HTML tags and attributes)
- Use select_one to look for elements using CSS selectors
- Use select to look fot all elements using CSS selectors
- We can parse locally using open() or parse a live website using requests

** HTML tags and attributes = tagname (name), class(class_), id(id), etc.
** CSS selectors => more or less similar with HTML tags, but can etter specify an element

Legality of Web Scraping:
- Don't commercialize on copyrighted content
- Don't commercialize on data that requires authentication
- Prioritize public APIs
- Respect the owner (don't accidentally commit a DDoS attack)
- add '/robots/txt' on the end of the url to check which are allowed

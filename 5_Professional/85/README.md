#### Day 85 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Typing Speed Test
#### Things I implemented: GUI, APIs

#### In order to check for errors, I used "https://textgears.com/api" using Text Validation API
#### The equation to count WPM is taken from "https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations" 
#### I can't really check if the code works well or not, but it can indeed show a result

#### It might not work as intended in repl.it due to environment issues

Application Programming Interface (API):

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of 
    commands, functions, protocols, and objects
    that programmers can use to create software or interact
    with an external system.

    # Focus -> interact with an external system 
    # Take Live Data from other websites

    # Make a request through the API to get information
    # Must follow a set of rules

    Analogy
    # Websites -> restaurant
    # Data -> kitchen
    # API -> menu (interact with the menu)

'''
    API interface between user and data
    API endpoint -> location of the data
    API request -> try to withdraw data from the website

    GET request -> get
'''


# JSON -> commonly used -> minimalist, not many indents and spaces, small size
# like IKEA

'''
    Requests -> returns Response Code
    # look at the first number
    # 1xx -> wait
    # 2xx -> successful
    # 3xx -> No permission, go away
    # 4xx -> You screwed up
    # 5xx -> server screwed up

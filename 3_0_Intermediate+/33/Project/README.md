#### Day 33 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: ISS Location + Nighttime Detector
#### Things I Implemented: SMTPLIB, API, DATETIME, REQUESTS, JSON

#### What the program does: 
- Periodically (every 30 minutes) notify the user through email if the ISS is on top of them

#### Public APIs:
- ISS Location: http://open-notify.org/
- Sunrise/Sunset: https://sunrise-sunset.org/api

#### There are limits to the api requests, and since it is executed every 30 minutes, it needs to be run in the background -> don't run it

### CAPSTONE PROJECT

#### Day 23 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Turtle Crossing Game
#### Things I implemented: Turtle, Inheritance, Game Logic, Random

#### What the program does:
- This is a shabby imitation of Crossy Roads (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossy_Road)

#### The Game is different from the course, since I added a main menu and probably different logic in the game
#### It will not work well when you play them in repl.it

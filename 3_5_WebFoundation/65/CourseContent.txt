1. Color Theory
- Art and Science of creating the right colour pallette
- Be Aware of the Mood
  a. Red: Love, Energy, and Intensity
  b. Yellow: Joy, Intellect, Attention (EXTREME)
  c. Green: Freshness, Growth, Safety -> Food
  d. Blue: Stability, Trust, Serenity -> Trustworthiness
  e. Purple: Royalty, Wealth, Feminity
- Make sure you're using the correct intention and correct Color
* Using colors with distance of 2 -> Analogous Colours 
* Using colors opposing one another -> Complementary Colours -> Attention -> grabbing Attention
** Colour Discord-> dont use complementary for text and background text
* Triadic color pallette, Square Color
* Look for color pallette -> adobe color

2. Typography
- Fonts DO MATTER
- Type of Fonts: 
  a. Serif: Feet at the end -> marble carvings -> serious and older -> letterhead -> Traditional, Stable, Respectable
  b. Sans Serif -> Perfect right angle -> approachable and friendly -> Sensible, Simple, Straightforward
  c. Script -> Personal, Creative, Elegant
  d. Display -> Friendly, Loud, Amusing
  e. Modern -> Stylish, Chic, Smart
- Fonts have Emotions
- Things to look out for: Open Shapes, Ample intercharacter spacing, unambiguous forms, varying proportions
- Use 2 Different Fonts: Similar Moods and Era Or Contrast (Serif and Sans-Serif, or changing weights)

3. User Interface Design
- Hierarchy
  * We are always drawn to bigger Things
  * Hierarchy of importance -> most important -> emphasized
  * Hierarchy -> Uses color, size
- Layout
- Alignment
  * Reduce number of alignment points
- White Space (empty space around texts)
- Audience -> Depends on the Audience

4. User Experience Design
- Simplicity = Keep things Simple
- Consistency = For example: Nav Bar should be consistent
- Reading Patterns = F Layout, Z Layout (faster)
- All Platform Design = Make sure its adaptable to any Platform
- Don't Use UI/UX for Evil (Whatever that is): Patterns that is beneficial for company and bad for users

### CAPSTONE PROJECT

#### Day 39-40 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Flight Club Application
#### Things I Implemented: API, Requests, API Authentication, Datetime, Regex, OS

#### What the program does:
- User can add new members to the database (in google sheets)
- User can look for cheap flights
- If there are cheap flights, send email to all members

#### Public APIs:
- Flight Search: https://tequila-api.kiwi.com/
- Handling Google Sheets: https://sheety.co/

#### This project has so many private APIs, I decided to use environment variables

#### Day 32 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Automatic Birthday Wisher
#### Things I Implemented: SMTPLIB, Random, Datetime, Pandas

#### What the program does:
- Checks current date and send a birthday wishing email to those who have their birthday at that time

#### This program should be run periodically for it to work as intended, I run it on python anywhere (scheduled task)
#### I improved the code with input

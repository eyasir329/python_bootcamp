#### Day 16 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Coffee Machine (OOP) 
#### Things I implemented: Classes and Objects, Functions and Recursions, System Module

#### Link to repl.it: There are no repl.it link since this project is basically just learning how to use objects in oop (I think the objects are provided by the course)

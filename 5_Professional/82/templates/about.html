        <p>Hello there, welcome to my portofolio website</p>
        <p>My name is Matthew Adrianus Mulyono, and this is my portofolio website</p>
        <p>This website contains information about my finished projects while doing the 100 Days of Python course</p>
        <p>Since there are like around 80 projects, I only included the projects that I liked to be shown here</p>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase my projects and improve my backend building skills using flask framework</p>
        <p>Sorry for the 'not exactly cool' web design. I'm not experienced enough in frontend ðŸ˜…</p>

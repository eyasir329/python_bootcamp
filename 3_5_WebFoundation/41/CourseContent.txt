How the Internet works:
- Internet: a long piece of wire that connects different computer to each other
- Computer that is online 24/7, store lots of data -> a server
- Computer that people use -> a client
1. Browser -> send message to ISP -> relay to DNS Server (like a phonebook)
2. DNS Server -> find an IP Address with that domain name, and sends back the IP Address
3. Client -> sends a direct request to the IP Address through the internet backbone
4. Similar to sending mail to friends outside country
5. Server returns back the files and data to the client

- Browser: software that allows you to look up ip address and receive data, rendering them
- Data received: HTML, CSS, JS
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): structure of Website
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): styling of Website
- JS (Javascript): Behaviour of a Website

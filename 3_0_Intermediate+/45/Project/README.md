#### Day 45 Project of 100 Days of Code
#### Project Name: Top 100 Movies
#### Things i implemented: requests, beautiful soup, web scraping

#### The program can't work well, since there are some countermeasures i can't exactly counter
#### Since i can't extract the H3 (containing the title), i extracted the alt from image, which in some cases don't mention the movie title

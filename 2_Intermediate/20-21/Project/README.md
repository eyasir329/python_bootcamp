#### Day 20 & 21 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Snake Game
#### Things I implemented: Turtle, Slicing, Inheritance, File handling, and Game logic

#### What the program does:
- A Snake Game :) 
- Link to example: https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade

#### The Game is different from the course, since i added a main menu and speed in the snake game
#### There is a bug in the game where when the player press space, the program will crash (so don't press space in the middle of the game)
#### When the user tries to play in repl.it, it will not work well due to repl.it environment.
